# FocusCoding

VibeCoding has ruined the minds of many developers, who rely on AI way too much.  Students no longer learn when using AI.

FocusCoding is an app made to promote genuine learning and to remove distracting websites.  When running, the app checks system processes to see if any IDEs are running.  If so, AI and distracting websites are blocked.

Requires being ran with admin.
